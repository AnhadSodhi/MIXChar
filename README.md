# MIXChar

### Purpose
A Java project to demostrate my coding proficiency, as of December 2023.

This project does the following:
* Obtains and validates user input from the terminal
* Converts each char of the input into it's MIXChar representation
* Packs 11 of those MIXChars into an unsigned long
* Prints the long to the console
* Unpacks the unsigned long, coverts each char back to UTF-8, and prints the message (the original input) to the console

## Usage Instructions
* Download all of the files
* Run TestMIXChar.java and follow the instructions in the terminal
